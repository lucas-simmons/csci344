***Please answer the following two questions:***

**1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?**
A join lets you make a query from multiple tables within one query, 
it can useful when connecting multiple datapoints between tables.

**2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?**

The user_id is unique. Users will have the same first name, last name, and change their username.
